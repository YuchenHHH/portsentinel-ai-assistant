# Resolution Summary

**Incident ID:** ALR-861600
**Resolution Outcome:** SUCCESS
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-20T01:49:03.740615

## Error Details
- **Error Identified:** Container data issue
- **Root Cause:** Data synchronization problem

## Actions Taken
- Query the database to retrieve all records for container number 'CMAU0000020' ordered by creation time descending: SELECT * FROM container WHERE cntr_no = 'CMAU0000020' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
- Identify duplicate container records for 'CMAU0000020' by selecting all records with the same container number, vessel_id, and eta_ts where created_at is less than the maximum created_at for each group: SELECT c.* FROM container c JOIN (SELECT cntr_no, vessel_id, eta_ts, MAX(created_at) AS max_created_at FROM container WHERE cntr_no = 'CMAU0000020' GROUP BY cntr_no, vessel_id, eta_ts) keep ON keep.cntr_no = c.cntr_no AND keep.vessel_id = c.vessel_id AND keep.eta_ts = c.eta_ts WHERE c.created_at < keep.max_created_at;
- Delete all duplicate container records for 'CMAU0000020' while keeping only the latest record per vessel_id and eta_ts group: DELETE c FROM container c JOIN (SELECT cntr_no, vessel_id, eta_ts, MAX(created_at) AS max_created_at FROM container WHERE cntr_no = 'CMAU0000020' GROUP BY cntr_no, vessel_id, eta_ts) keep ON keep.cntr_no = c.cntr_no AND keep.vessel_id = c.vessel_id AND keep.eta_ts = c.eta_ts WHERE c.created_at < keep.max_created_at;
- Verify that only the latest container record per vessel_id and eta_ts remains for 'CMAU0000020' by re-running: SELECT * FROM container WHERE cntr_no = 'CMAU0000020' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
