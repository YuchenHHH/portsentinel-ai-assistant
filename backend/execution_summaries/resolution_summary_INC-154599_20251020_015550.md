# Resolution Summary

**Incident ID:** INC-154599
**Resolution Outcome:** SUCCESS
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-20T01:55:50.881042

## Error Details
- **Error Identified:** Container data issue
- **Root Cause:** Data synchronization problem

## Actions Taken
- Search the edi_message_processing.log for entries related to the message reference 'REF-IFT-0007' to confirm if the acknowledgment process was delayed or failed by running: grep -i "REF-IFT-0007" edi_message_processing.log
- Query the edi_message table to identify all messages with status 'ERROR' or status 'PARSED' but with ack_at as NULL by running: SELECT edi_id, message_ref, sender, receiver, status, sent_at, ack_at, error_text FROM edi_message WHERE status = 'ERROR' OR (status = 'PARSED' AND ack_at IS NULL);
- If the message with message_ref 'REF-IFT-0007' is found stuck in 'ERROR' status with ack_at as NULL, manually update its status to 'ACKED', set ack_at to the current timestamp, and clear error_text by running: UPDATE edi_message SET status = 'ACKED', ack_at = NOW(), error_text = NULL WHERE message_ref = 'REF-IFT-0007';
- After manual acknowledgment update, re-query the edi_message table to verify that the message 'REF-IFT-0007' status is now 'ACKED' and ack_at is not NULL by running: SELECT edi_id, message_ref, sender, receiver, status, sent_at, ack_at, error_text FROM edi_message WHERE message_ref = 'REF-IFT-0007';
- If the message 'REF-IFT-0007' is not found stuck in 'ERROR' or 'PARSED' with NULL ack_at, verify the acknowledgment logic and network connectivity between sender 'LINE-PSA' and receiver 'PSA-TOS' to ensure no messages are delayed or lost.
