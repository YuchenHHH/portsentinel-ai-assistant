This can be due to server delays, network issues, or other factors. As a result, the message remains in the ERROR status and doesn’t have the expected ack_at timestamp, preventing it from being processed further, which disrupts data flow and shipment tracking.\n\nFor example, if PSA receives an IFTMIN message from LINE-PSA but the acknowledgment isn't sent to the sender (PSA-TOS), the message stays in ERROR status with a NULL value for ack_at. The lack of acknowledgment means that the message isn’t processed or moved forward.",
